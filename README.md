# 05-Homework

This assignment is a work day scheduler that allows the user to type notes or reminders into a text area, and save them for later use. Another feature is that the time blocks change color as they time of day passes. The current time highlights red, while future time is displayed as green, and past time is displayed as grey. This uses local storage so that even if the user closes their browser, they can return at any time to view or edit their saved notes. It also uses moment.js to determind the time zome that the user is operating in. 

With additional time available put into this assignment I would have explored more efficient ways to assign classes to the rows, but I wasn't quite able to get there within the given time frame this week.
